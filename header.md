## Overview

The landing zone Terraform module is designed to accelerate deployment of individual landing zones within an Azure tenant.
We use the [AzAPI](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/azure/azapi/latest) provider to create the subscription and deploy the resources in a single `terraform apply` step.

The module is designed to be instantiated many times, once for each desired landing zone.

This is currently split logically into the following capabilities:

- Subscription creation and management group placement
- Networking - deploy multiple vnets with:
  - Hub & spoke connectivity (peering to a hub network)
  - vWAN connectivity
  - Mesh peering (peering between spokes)
- Role assignments
- Resource provider (and feature) registration
- Resource group creation
- User assigned managed identity creation
  - Federated credential configuration for GitHub Actions, Terraform Cloud, and other providers.

> When creating virtual network peerings, be aware of the [limit of peerings per virtual network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-network%2Ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

We would like feedback on what's missing in the module.
Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-lz-vending/issues) if you have any suggestions.

## Change log

Please see the [GitHub releases pages](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-lz-vending/releases) for change log information.

## Notes

Please see the content in the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-lz-vending/wiki) for more detailed information.

## Example

The below example created a landing zone subscription with two virtual networks.
One virtual network is in the default location of the subscription, the other is in a different location.

The virtual networks are peered with the supplied hub network resource ids, they are also peered with each other using the mesh peering option.
