This module uses [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/s) versioning.

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

* `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible/breaking changes,
* `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
* `PATCH` version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

## Upgrade process

If you are upgrading to a new `MINOR` or `PATCH` release, you will not see any breaking changes.
If you are using the Terraform registry, you can update the version number for the module.

For a new `MAJOR` release, you will see breaking changes.
We will publish guidance in the release notes on GitHub.
